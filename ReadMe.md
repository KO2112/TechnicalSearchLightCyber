2 Test cases, first one comes with positive and negative
However we would not be able to create a negative test case for the second one

I tried to use as much as classes and little tools, however, as there are only 2 test cases, this is all I can show :)

I would be happy to explain this little framework in the interview. Thanks for the opportunity

Kind regards
